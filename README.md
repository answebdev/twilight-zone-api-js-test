# Twilight Zone API JS Test
This is a test site created in order to test my custom-built [The Twilight Zone API](https://github.com/answebdev/twilight-zone-api "The Twilight Zone API"). The API I created has a total of six endpoints: one endpoint for each of the five seasons, and one endpoint for all of the seasons. On this test website, you can choose to go to the page displaying the data for all seasons, as well as going to pages by season. This test site was written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
